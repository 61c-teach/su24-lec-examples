# Lecture Examples

This repository holds coding examples used in lecture in the SU24 iteration of CS61C. After completing Lab 0, you should be able to clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:61c-teach/su24-lec-examples.git
```

or 

```
git clone https://github.com/61c-teach/su24-lec-examples.git
```

The examples for each lecture are in the `lecXX` folders, and the exact commands used to produce the given output are in the lecture slides. A green outline around a textbox indicates that it is a valid terminal prompt to produce the given output.

Feel free to make any modifications or use this repository to test out anything you want to with C!
